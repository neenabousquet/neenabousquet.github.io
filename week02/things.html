         Things, how does one own or have? Is the intangible, just as valuable as the tangible? Are the ideals, and show of wealth just as important as actual wealth? These are all things that can be explored and traced back to the innate sense of consumerism and developed ego, which can be traced back centuries ago.

         We all want to show off when we are doing better, if one comes to you with a story, you are compelled to think of a better one you can share. This one-up culture is especially true in the new age of social media. What can you have that you can show off. For example, the large red boots that recently went viral, they were extremely impractical and often people had to cut the shoe to even get their feet out. But it was seen as a status symbol, a display of wealth that you can spend $400 on a shoe that can only be worn once.

         It is simply a lavish display, that you are part of a sub-culture most people cannot afford. The difference now is that the people who cannot afford it are obsessed with the ones who can. Birthing a new career, The Influencer. Something almost everyone aspires to be. I believe we are at the peak of our consumerism era, and soon there will be a new wave of anti-consumerism, which in itself is already a contradiction of its own cause.
