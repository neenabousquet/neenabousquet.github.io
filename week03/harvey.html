                Net Art is such an interesting section of media. The artists were so explorative and it is a very recent art form. I have high hopes that this will continue to be something that I can draw inspiration from. It seems like artists have many reasons for their work, some protective, some gags and some deeply emotional pieces.

                One of my favorite parts of net art is the interaction with it. It is an explorative space, one where you transcend the viewer experience, you become a critic, a player in the game. It reminds me of the movie “Playtime” by Jacques Tati, this is a movie where you transcend the viewer experience and are truly based within the world. It is so immersive and complete that you almost don’t even recognize that it is a movie. I have had similar experiences with net art pieces.

                Looking closer into Aureia Harvey, I can appreciate her perspective within this interview. The fact that she really entered it for the money, through her internship, and ended up finding her passion. The way her work is so unapologetically her, both in her sculpture and online. I can appreciate as an artist that she is multi-faceted and doesn’t prescribe to the notion that you must choose a field. My favorite part of the interview was when she discussed her passion for turning something physical into digital through her 3D printer. I've always said my favorite thing about art was having an idea and making it come to a physical realization. So to see her why, her reason for creating art, inspired me, I always feel as though one can only be successful if there is a why.
